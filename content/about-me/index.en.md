Hello! I'm Rayane Nakib (ريَّان نقيب), a Control Engineering student at the University of Béjaïa, and I’m 21 years old.
I have a deep passion for programming and everything related to free and open-source software, as well as Linux operating systems.
I also enjoy running and managing home servers. I love exploring new fields and technologies constantly.
Besides that, I enjoy reading and have a keen interest in studying physics and law as intellectual hobbies.
I'm also a big fan of music, novels, anime, and manga, and I absolutely love watching movies and TV shows.
Here, I share my passions, experiences, and everything new I learn and enjoy.<br><br>
