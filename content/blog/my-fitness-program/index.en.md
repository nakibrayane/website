## Exerces Snaks

Exercise Snaks are a way to either enhance or maintain thing like VO2 max,
muscular endurance, etc.

Exercise snaks are most useful when you're not keeping up with your
fitness routine. And under those conditoins exercies snacks are a terrific way
to maintain the fitness that you've already built and developed.

- Exercises Examples:
    - jumping jacks
    - run up stairs
    - push ups
    - pull ups
    - dips

## Flexibility 

Holding static stretches is the best way to improve your overall flexibility.
Hold each major muscle group in a static stretch for 30-60 seconds and repeat
daily. I do this at night before sleep.

While holding the stretch, long exhales will further relax muscles and deepen
the stretch.

## Supplements

I don't take any Supplements.
